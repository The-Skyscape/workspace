## Claude Workspace Generation Prompt (Skyscape)

You are generating the initial implementation for the **Skyscape workspace**, a secure, AI-powered developer environment built using the MVC pattern provided by `devtools`. The application uses HTMX with HATEOAS, daisyUI for UI components, and Go.

The backend will manage all server-side state, and the frontend will use **HTMX** to interact with server-rendered views only ‚Äî no API endpoints are needed, only server-side callbacks that render, redirect, or refresh pages. All permissions and view logic are defined in controllers, which have access to the current `User`, as well as the `GitRepo` and `Workspace` models.

### üß≠ Site Map & Feature Overview

#### 1. Homepage (`/`)

* If not logged in ‚Üí show CTA, login/register buttons
* If authenticated ‚Üí redirect to `/dashboard`
* Use daisyUI `hero`, `btn`, `card`, and brand logo

#### 2. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

* Shows list of owned and shared repositories (via `Permission`)
* Buttons:

  * ‚ÄúCreate Repository‚Äù (opens modal)
  * ‚ÄúAsk Claude Something‚Äù (AI assistant)
* Sidebar:

  * User avatar
  * Link to `/settings`
  * Button: ‚ÄúLaunch Workspace‚Äù ‚Üí runs Docker

#### 3. Repository View (`/repos/:id`)

* Tabs: `tabs`, `tab-active`, HTMX-loaded:

  * Code View: Read-only Git tree using `GitRepo`
  * Issues: list + create/edit modal
  * Pull Requests: list + open new PR
  * Actions: log of AI interactions
* Buttons:

  * ‚ÄúLaunch Workspace‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúGenerate PR with AI‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúAsk Claude a Question‚Äù

#### 4. Pull Request Create/Edit (`/repos/:id/prs/new`)

* Form:

  * Title
  * Description
  * Branch selectors (use `GitRepo`)
* Claude Assist: suggest description, auto-open PR from change
* Status: draft / open / merged / closed

#### 5. Issue Tracker (`/repos/:id/issues`)

* List in cards (`card`, `badge`, `avatar`)
* Filters: status, tags (use `dropdown` or `tabs`)
* Modal: Create/Edit issue
* Mention system (`@user`) optional for future

#### 6. Actions Log (`/repos/:id/actions`)

* Table of:

  * Claude PR generations
  * Claude Q\&A
  * Summarizations
* Rerun or clone previous actions

#### 7. Workspace Launcher (`/workspace/:repoID`)

* Controller starts a code-server Docker container via `Workspace` model
* Show status:

  * Provisioning
  * Running (redirect to workspace)
  * Failed (with retry)
* Button: ‚ÄúShutdown Workspace‚Äù

#### 8. Auth Pages (`/login`, `/register`, `/logout`)

* Forms styled with `input`, `label`, `btn`, `form-control`
* Flash error messages on invalid login
* Redirect to `/dashboard` after success

#### 9. User Settings (`/settings`)

* Edit email, password
* Toggle Claude assistant
* Default docker image for new workspaces

### ‚ú® UI Guidelines (daisyUI)

Use daisyUI classes throughout:

* Buttons: `btn`, `btn-primary`, `btn-outline`
* Forms: `input`, `label`, `form-control`, `modal`
* Layouts: `card`, `tabs`, `navbar`, `drawer`
* Colors: soft pastel, match Skyscape brand (dreamy/cloudy)

---

### üîÑ Controller + HTMX Behavior

* Controllers define:

  * Callback permissions
  * Rendered templates (`views/`)
  * `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-swap`, `hx-target` logic
* Views use partials and fragments to swap components
* HATEOAS: No APIs ‚Äî only navigable actions from links and buttons

---

### ‚úÖ Deliverables

* Implement all models in `models/`
* Create views using `views/` templates and daisyUI
* Write controllers with logic for:

  * Access control
  * Git interactions (via `GitRepo`)
  * Workspace lifecycle (via `Workspace`)
  * AI assistant actions (via `Action`)
* Ensure all flows work cleanly with HTMX over server-rendered pages
